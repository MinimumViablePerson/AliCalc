# AliCalc

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/swharden/swharden/_apis/build/status/swharden.AliCalc?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/swharden/swharden/_build/latest?definitionId=12&branchName=master)

**AliCalc is a tool for calculating ideal stock aliquot parameters for electrophysiology experiments.** Ideal aliquots are near the solubility limit of a compound (to keep aliquots small), but can be easily transformed to target concentrations by diluting individual aliquots into intermediate volumes. Aliquots are typically diluted to 10 mL for delivery via a syringe pump, or added directly into ACSF.
